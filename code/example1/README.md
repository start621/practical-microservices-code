# Example 1

Our first project will look at creating a simple User service to manager user information and an activity service that audits
all events in our system. 


## The API

Our user service is a very simple CRUD application with a hopefully familar API.

+ Get a list of users
+ Get a single user
+ Create a user
+ Update a user
+ Delete a user
