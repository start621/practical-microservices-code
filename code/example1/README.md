# Example 1 (User Service)

Our first project will look at creating a simple user management service that stores information about users in a system.

## The API

Our user service is a very simple CRUD application with a hopefully familar API.

+ Get a list of users
+ Get a single user
+ Create a user
+ Update a user
+ Delete a user
