# Polyglot Persistence

One of the key aspects of microservices is that each microservice should be scaled and operated independently of other services in the system.
This leads us towards the idea of giving each service it's own datastore. 

As somone who likes things neat and tidy, this really appeals to my way of thinking. It means your datastorage will be small,
more focussed and less confused. In a typical monolith application databases frequently get too large and too complex to manage.
