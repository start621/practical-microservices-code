# Intro

> Microservices are not a free lunch. You trade code complexity for operational complexity.

Success in building a microservice architecture depends on getting many elements right. These include continuous integration, testing, logging, request tracing, messaging, service registration and discovery, monitoring and much more. This book aims
to walk you through how to build a microservice architecure from a practical, real world lens. 

We will focus heavily on providing working code examples and projects in multiple languages to get a deeper overview of the tools and processes needed for a successful microservice based system. 

## The monolith

## Benefits of Microservices

There are many benefits to a microservice architcture. The most obvious is that it breaks apart the complexity of a large monolithic application into smaller parts.
Most companies are faced with the challenge of iterating quickly on products, adding new features constantly, and in a large monolithic application this can be difficult.
Microservices make it easy to change parts of an application without the fear of breaking things.

## Drawback of Microservices

Although microservices have many benefits, they also come with some drawbacks. For starters, when we break a large application into microservices we have more applications to monitor and deploy.
For a small number of services this isn't too bad, but as you increase the number of services in your application this can quickly become very hard to mangage. For this reason it's important to
have good processes in place around automation, monitoring and deployment of your microservices.
